\# 2.10 Serialization Rules (Beginner-Friendly)



Serialization rules define \*\*how Ethian domain objects are represented when crossing boundaries\*\*:

\- APIs

\- Domain Events

\- Persistence

\- Inter-service communication



Correct serialization is critical in payment systems to avoid:

\- money corruption

\- rounding errors

\- ID ambiguity

\- timezone bugs



---



\## 2.10.1 General Principles



All serialized domain data must follow these rules:

\- Be explicit (no hidden defaults)

\- Be versionable

\- Be backward compatible where possible

\- Preserve domain meaning exactly



---



\## 2.10.2 Identifier Serialization



Domain IDs (MerchantId, PaymentId, InvoiceId, etc.)



Rules:

\- Serialize IDs as strings

\- Treat IDs as opaque values (do not parse or infer meaning)

\- Do not embed meaning (type, timestamp, shard) inside IDs

\- Never reuse IDs



Example:

```json

{ "paymentId": "pay\_8f92a1..." }
