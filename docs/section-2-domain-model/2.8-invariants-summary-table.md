# 2.8 Invariants Summary TableThis table summarizes the **critical invariants** defined across the Ethian domain model.These rules must **always hold true** to ensure correctness and financial safety.| Domain Area | Invariant | Enforced By ||------------|-----------|-------------|| Merchant | Merchant must have a stable `merchantId` | Merchant Aggregate || Merchant | Merchant must be active to accept payments | Merchant Aggregate || Invoice | Invoice currency is immutable once issued | Invoice Aggregate || Invoice | Invoice cannot be PAID unless total captured amount equals amount due | Invoice Aggregate || Invoice | Expired invoices must not accept new payments | Invoice State Machine || Invoice | Overpayment must be rejected or explicitly handled | Invoice Aggregate || Payment | Payment amount must be greater than zero | Payment Aggregate || Payment | Payment currency is immutable | Payment Aggregate || Payment | Payment capture must be idempotent | Payment State Machine || Payment | Refund total must not exceed captured amount | Payment Aggregate || Payment | Failed or voided payments must not impact ledger | Payment State Machine || Ledger | Every ledger posting must be balanced | Ledger Model || Ledger | Ledger entries are append-only | Ledger Model || Ledger | Ledger is the single source of financial truth | Ledger Model || Settlement | Settlement amount must be non-negative | Settlement Aggregate || Settlement | Settlement state transitions must be monotonic | Settlement Aggregate || Cross-domain | Invoice updates must occur via domain events | Domain Events Model (2.9) || Cross-domain | Ledger postings must reference a valid business event | Ledger Model |---## How to use this table- Treat this as a **safety checklist** when implementing code.- Any feature that violates one of these invariants is a **bug**.- During reviews, ask: *Which invariant enforces this rule?*Next: see **2.9 Domain Events Model**.
