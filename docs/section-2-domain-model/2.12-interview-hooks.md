# 2.12 Interview Hooks (How to Explain This in Interviews)

This section provides concise explanations and hooks to help explain
Ethian’s domain model clearly in interviews.

---

## Q1: Why do you separate Invoice and Payment?

**Answer:**
An Invoice represents money expected, while a Payment represents
the lifecycle of an attempt to move money.
This separation allows retries, partial payments, failures, and refunds
without corrupting invoice state.

---

## Q2: Why do you need a Ledger if you already track Payment states?

**Answer:**
Payment states describe *what happened* operationally.
The Ledger represents *financial truth*.
Only the ledger guarantees balance, auditability, and reconciliation.

---

## Q3: Why double-entry accounting?

**Answer:**
Double-entry ensures money is never created or destroyed.
Every movement has an equal and opposite entry,
which makes errors detectable and audits reliable.

---

## Q4: Why are failed payments excluded from the ledger?

**Answer:**
Only completed financial movements belong in the ledger.
Failed or voided payments do not move money and therefore
must not affect financial truth.

---

## Q5: Why are domain events required for cross-aggregate updates?

**Answer:**
Domain events decouple aggregates while preserving consistency.
They allow Invoice, Ledger, Settlement, and Webhooks
to react without tight coupling.

---

## Q6: What is the single source of financial truth?

**Answer:**
The ledger is the single source of truth.
Invoices and payments are derived views of financial intent and execution,
but the ledger records what actually happened.

---

## Q7: What mistakes does this model prevent?

**Answer:**
- Overpayments
- Double captures
- Unbalanced settlements
- Ledger corruption
- Hidden money creation
- Tight coupling between services

---

## One-line summary

> *Ethian separates intent, execution, and accounting so that
payments remain correct, auditable, and scalable under failure.*
