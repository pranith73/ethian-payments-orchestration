# 2.0 Domain Model — Why this matters (Beginner-Friendly)

This section defines Ethian’s **domain model**: the real-world business concepts (Merchant, Payment, Invoice, Ledger, etc.) and how they relate.

A good domain model helps us:

1) **Build correctly, faster**
- When names and boundaries are clear, every microservice, API, and database table becomes easier to design.
- We reduce rework because everyone shares the same mental model.

2) **Prevent business bugs**
- Payments are high-risk: duplicates, double-settlement, incorrect refunds, broken accounting.
- A domain model makes “what must never happen” explicit (invariants) and ties those rules to specific objects.

3) **Scale the system safely**
- As features grow (retries, partial payments, chargebacks, reconciliation), the model ensures we extend the system without breaking core meaning.

4) **Keep documentation and code aligned**
- Section 2 is the single source for domain meaning.
- Future code (entities, events, state machines) must match what is defined here.

## Scope of Section 2

Section 2 covers:

- **Core entities** (Merchant, Customer, Invoice, Payment, Ledger…)
- **Relationships** between them (ER diagram)
- **Value objects** (Money, Currency, IDs, Addresses…)
- **Aggregates & invariants** (what rules must always hold)
- **State machines** (Payment & Invoice lifecycle)
- **Ledger model** (double-entry)
- **Domain events** (what we publish/consume between services)
- **Serialization rules** (how data is represented safely)
- **Beginner examples** and **interview hooks**

## How to read this section

Read in order:

1. Start with **Core Domain Entities (2.1)** to learn the “nouns” of Ethian.
2. Use the **ER Diagram (2.2)** to understand how those nouns connect.
3. Learn the “small building blocks” in **Value Objects (2.3)**.
4. Then move into rules, lifecycles, and events.

By the end of Section 2, you should be able to answer:

- What is a Payment vs an Invoice?
- What states can a Payment go through?
- How do we ensure money is never created or lost in the ledger?
- What events does the domain emit when key changes occur?
