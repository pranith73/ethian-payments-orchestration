# Ethian — Payments Orchestration Platform

Ethian is an educational, open-source **fintech payments orchestration** project built in Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.x.  
This repository currently focuses on **Section 1 (High-Level Design)** and **Section 2 (Domain Model)** of the Ethian project template.

## Tech Stack (up to Section 2)

- Java **21** (LTS)
- Spring Boot **3.x** (added later as modules)
- Maven
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
- Git + GitHub (public repo later)

> ⚠️ Implementation is intentionally limited to the scope of **Section 1 + Section 2**.  
> Future sections (3–13) will be added after the initial design and domain model are stable.
